== 0.1.2 / 2008-07-12

* Implemented the named wormhole. catch and throw methods now receive a name
parameter as the first param which is a symbol.
* Added an exception class to make a constraint for syntax

Now you must call return method after the catch block like this:

  Wormhole.catch do
    # something
  end.return

This code raises Wormhole::LateReturnError

  w = Wormhole.catch do
    # something
  end
	w.return

== 0.1.1 / 2008-07-04

* changed API according to the suggestion of @yugui.

== 0.0.1 / 2008-07-02

* initial release.
